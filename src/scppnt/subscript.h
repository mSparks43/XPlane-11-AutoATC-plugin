  /*!  \brief Subscript index type
   
   This definition describes the default SCPPNT data type used for
   indexing into SCPPNT matrices and vectors.  The data type should
   signed and be wide enough to index into large arrays.  It defaults to an
   "int", but can be overriden at compile time redefining SCPPNT_SUBSCRIPT_TYPE,
   e.g.
   
   g++ -DSCPPNT_SUBSCRIPT_TYPE='int_fast64_t'  ...

/*! \brief Offset for () indexing
 () indexing in SCPPNT means 1-offset, i.e. x(1) and A(1,1) are the
 first elements.  This offset is left as a macro for future
 purposes, but should not be changed in the current release.
