http://www.smallwaters.com/software/cpp/scppnt.html

This release updates original work contributed by 
Brad Hanson (http://www.b-a-h.com/) in 2001.

This directory contains the Simple C++
Numerical Toolkit (SCPPNT) source files. 

The doc directory contains documentation for SCPPNT.
The file scppnt.html contains a brief description
of SCPPNT. The latest version of this file is
available at 
http://www.smallwaters.com/software/cpp/scppnt.html.

The directory src within the doc directory contains
source code documentation created using doxygen
(http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html).
Open the file index.html in the doc/src directory
with a web browser to view this documentation.
The file scppnt.dox contains the doxygen 
configuration file used to produce the source
code documentation.

The examples directory contains some example programs using
SCPPNT. The file Makefile contains a makefile for compiling
the examples, running them, and checking the example program
output using gcc and cygwin under Windows Vista. Makefile is
easily modified to run with gcc under various Unix types, and
under MacOS. The file Makefile.bcc is an analogous makefile 
using Borland C++ 5.5 under Windows.
