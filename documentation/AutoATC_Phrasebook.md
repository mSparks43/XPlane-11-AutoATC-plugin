# AutoATC Phrasebook
&nbsp;

This is a quick reference phrasebook for use with AutoATC, a combined AI/ATC plugin and radio communication training tool for X-Plane [(X-Plane.org file library page)](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/45663-main-installation-files-for-autoatc-for-xplane-11/).

This phrasebook is a mere quick reference aid for pilots. Its content is subject to change as AutoATC is still under heavy development.

## 1. Placeholders
In the following chapters, “[]” represents a placeholder, which is to be replaced with the agency name or callsign or frequency, etc. used in the current session.

&nbsp;

>**[agency]**: The agency that is communicated with, e.g. "Heathrow Tower" or "Frankfurt Approach"

>**[altitude]**: The cleared or current altitude, measured in feet e.g. "5000" or flight level e.g. "level 350"

>**[callsign]**: Your callsign, e.g. "G-COOL" or "Condor EDC" or "Speedbird 74" ATC may reply with a shortened callsign (see AutoATC ground school)

>**[clearance]**: A procedural clearance to a destination when approaching/departing an airport

>**[fix]**: Departure or arrival fix that is to be crossed before clearance for the next fix or flight phase. Can be a navigation aid or VFR reporting point

>**[heading]**: A magnetic heading to fly while being vectored by ATC in IFR

>**[QNH]**: QNH, as expressed in hectopascals, e.g. "1006". US and Canada uses inches mercury, e.g. "29.82"

>**[runway]**: The runway designator, e.g. "28L", "05"

>**[squawk]**: Transponder code, e.g. "2168"

>**[taxiways]**: A list of taxiways, e.g. "Y R M F1"

>**[time]**: Expresses minutes after the hour, or 4 digit 24 hour time UTC if more than 1 hour in the future

>**[weatherinfo]**: *If the airport has ATIS*, this is the current weather information, e.g. "with november"

&nbsp;

## 2. Communications
Communications are presented in this form:



**Note:** Further information about a request, such as required conditions are mentioned in a note below the respective heading.

**Request:**
>The request that invokes a reply by ATC. Variations of a request are indicated with an asterisk
	
**Readback:**
>If a request lists one or more readbacks, ATC replies will have to be read back. The correct readback depends on the content of the reply by ATC.

#### 2.6.2 Reporting the current position
**Request:**
>[Agency], [callsign], position [fix].
